This project was developed as final project for the exam in Functional Languages 2021-2022 held by Prof. Alvise Span√≤ in Univeristy of Padova (Italy).

The TinyML folder contains the implementation of an interpreter for an ML style functional language, written in F# (Visual Studio).  
The project is not entirely coded by me, but a skeleton was provided by the professor.

The project can be divided in those main parts:

- **Lexer** parses the source code (a long string of text) in *tokens*.  
Accepted tokens are defined in `Lexer.fsl`.

- **Parser** receives the output of the *Lexer* as input and produces an abstract syntax tree.  
Valid language expressions are defined in `Parser.fsy`.  
The actual code for the parser is automatically generated by *Yacc*.

- **Type checking** checks the correctness of program types.  
All the needed types has to be specified by the programmer in the source code as type annotations.

- **Type inference** infer program types and also checks for types correctness.

- **Evaluator** evaluates the program.
